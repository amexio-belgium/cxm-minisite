    <p>Have you ever wondered about the various roles on a web development team, and what every person’s role entails? Why a java developer and a JavaScript developer are not interchangeable? After all, these “programming languages” sound mostly the same to the layperson.</p>
    <p>The web development team can be thought of as an IT crew that takes care of the code for one or multiple websites and apps. Naturally, they collaborate with other experts and teams. It’s also possible that one person fulfills multiple roles.</p>
    <p>These roles are all vital when it comes to building and maintaining an app or website. Here are some of the most common roles in a web development team here at AmeXio.</p>

    <h2><strong>Web Development Project Manager</strong></h2>
    <p>The digital project manager provides focus for the team on their various projects, and they help to keep it moving along on schedule. They manage the budget, take care of planning, and ensure the team is staffed with the best talent.</p>
    <h2><strong>Analyst</strong></h2>
    <p>This role is designed to be a proxy between the client, design, and development. He translates the requests (requirements) made by the client into clear specifications on how a certain functionality should behave. Functional analysts will also test these functionalities once the team has delivered them.</p>
    <h2><strong>Back-end developer</strong></h2>
    <p>This programmer writes code that controls what’s displayed on a website. The back-end developer uses programming languages like Java, .NET and PHP. These languages run on the server to create the webpage. That’s why we call it “server side” or “back-end”: When someone visits a website, the browser will fetch the page from the server.</p>
    <p>The back-end developer also integrates the website/app with other systems like other websites and CRM software.</p>
    <h2><strong>Front-end developer</strong></h2>
    <p>Working closely with his back-end colleague, the front-end developer takes care of the “frontend” or “client side”. Once the page is shown in the browser, it still requires layout to look nice. In order to do this, the developer writes CSS and HTML to tell the browser how to visually display the page.</p>
    <p>The front-end developer also writes JavaScript, which is used to create visual animations and is evermore used for dynamic applications containing features like log-in and other user interaction.</p>
    <h2><strong>Architect</strong></h2>
    <p>This person configures the infrastructure/hardware (server) on which the websites are running.</p>
    <p>In contrast with the back-end developer, the architect doesn’t work on the website itself but on everything that’s required to have one. They are in charge of creating an ideal environment for the website.</p>
    <h2><strong>UX designer/Graphic designer</strong></h2>
    <p>These are often separate roles but are sometimes combined. The UX (user experience) designer is in charge of mapping out the website in a raw sketch (a wireframe) so it’s clear for the visitors how they can use the website and navigate through it.</p>
    <p>The graphic designer creates a visual style for the website aligned with the corporate style guide. He also creates a visual design for each functionality as a guideline for the front-end developer, who will re-create this design by code.</p>
    <h2><strong>The (quality) tester</strong></h2>
    <p>This person tests every functionality that the team has made in every possible condition before the website becomes available to regular users. When something is not in order, he reports a bug to the developers.</p>
    <p>The tester does not simply click around in the application but follows a strict plan and procedure to make sure they will test every possibility.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Many other roles can be a part of a digital team such as a team lead, account manager, business analyst, data scientist, and SEO specialist. However, the above are the main roles that exist within a web development team for a consistent and performing online presence.</p>
