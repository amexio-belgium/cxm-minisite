    <h2>But what makes Adobe’s AI so powerful?</h2>
    <p>Adobe AI assistant and Adobe Firefly are built based on the group of models that adobe calls the Generative Experience Models. This combination of models is built with three key values in mind so that brands can take full use of them, without having to worry about the usual issues that come with AI tooling. </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data safety:</strong> These models are only trained on licensed and custom data provided by the brands. This way adobe guarantees that your generated output is not infringing on intellectual property from other brands. And because all the data is kept separate, there is no intermingling</li>
        <li><strong>Correctness:</strong> Due to the decomposition between the different models, it allows Adobe to do a lot of finetuning. This way they can ensure that the correctness is at the level that it needs to be.</li>
        <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Again because of all the decomposition Adobe holds the entire provenance for every operation that the models do. This provenance is exactly what they can give back to you as transparency.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The Strategic Impact:</h2>
    <p>With these announcements at the Summit, adobe signifies a transformative moment for business leaders and marketers. By integrating the powerfull generative AI tools into existing workflows it offers unprecended capabilities in personalisation, bringing in a new era of digital experiences.
