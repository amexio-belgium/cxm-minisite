	description="
	<p>After working with enterprise organization on the topic of content management for over 20 years, we have witnessed a number recurring challenges:</p> 
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Inconsistent Customer Experiences:</strong> Without an integrated platform, it’s difficult to deliver a consistent brand message across different touchpoints like web, mobile, and social media, leading to poor customer engagement.</li>
		<li><strong>Content locked in silos:</strong> Too often, organizations have their content shattered in silos. They struggle with inflexible CMS systems, locking content into specific formats and channels while forcing the same generic workflow for all types of authors.</li>
		<li><strong>Fragmented Systems:</strong> Businesses often use multiple, disconnected systems for content creation, management, and delivery. This fragmentation leads to inefficiencies, errors, and delayed time-to-market.</li>
		<li><strong>Slow time-to-market:</strong> As businesses grow, scaling content creation and distribution becomes a significant bottleneck. Without a robust content supply chain, it’s challenging to manage the volume and complexity of content required for omnichannel delivery, resulting in reduced time-to-market.</li>

<Faq headline="Questions we usually get">
	<FaqQuestion
		headline="How can we define our initial project scope?"
		headlineTag="h3"> 
		<p>At Amexio, we define the project’s initial scope by relying on Product Owners (POs). They focus on the product vision, identify key problems, and understand the target audience. POs gather and refine stakeholder inputs into user stories, which are then organized into a prioritized product backlog based on business value and cost. Our approach ensures this backlog remains dynamic, evolving iteratively to incorporate new ideas and adjustments, keeping the project aligned with its goals throughout.</p>
	</FaqQuestion>
	<FaqQuestion 
		headline="How can we estimate initial project budget?"
		headlineTag="h3" >
		<p>We estimate the initial project budget by calculating the cost of maintaining a stable Scrum Team over a set period. This involves identifying the required full-time equivalent (FTE) roles, including Business Consultants, Technical Leads, Developers, Testers, Architects, DevOps Engineers, and Project Managers. We prioritize team stability, understanding that simply increasing team size doesn’t linearly enhance productivity due to the overhead it creates. This approach ensures the project is both well-resourced and cost-efficient.</p>
	</FaqQuestion>
	<FaqQuestion 
		headline="How can we estimate the cost per user story?" >
		<p>We assign each task a value in Story Points using a method called Planning Poker. These points help estimate how much work the team can complete in a sprint, known as the team’s Velocity. Velocity is the total Story Points finished in a sprint and is key for predicting future work. After each sprint, Velocity is checked, and plans are adjusted, becoming more accurate over time. This ongoing process keeps project planning realistic and flexible.</p>
	</FaqQuestion>
	<FaqQuestion 
		headline="How does Amexio Fuse ensure project deadlines are met?">
		<p>We ensure project deadlines are met by embracing Agile principles, where scope details are flexible. By breaking down larger tasks into smaller, manageable pieces and regularly updating their estimates, our teams can adapt to changes and focus on completing the most critical elements on time. Backlog Grooming is essential in this process, as it helps prioritize tasks to deliver maximum business value. This approach not only ensures deadlines are met but also aligns them with delivering the most impactful outcomes.</p>
	</FaqQuestion>
	<FaqQuestion 
		headline="How much time should we spent analysing up-front?">
		<p>We allocate time for up-front analysis to reduce risk and uncertainty in Agile projects. This includes activities like technical analysis, prototyping, and feasibility studies, which help us understand the project landscape and mitigate risks related to business, technical, and cost/schedule factors. However, we defer detailed decision-making until necessary, allowing the project to adapt to new information. We establish high-level architecture early on, refining it during sprints to maintain flexibility and ensure the project remains aligned with customer value throughout its lifecycle.</p>
	</FaqQuestion>
	<FaqQuestion 
		headline="How can we organize testing?">
		<p>We organize testing by making sure it happens in every sprint, ensuring that each sprint results in a product that’s ready to ship. We use both automated and manual tests to check all parts of the product’s functionality and performance. By following a DevOps approach, we maintain continuous deployment and integration, keeping the product stable and quickly adaptable to changes. This ongoing testing helps us catch and fix issues early, reducing risks and improving the quality of the project.</p>
