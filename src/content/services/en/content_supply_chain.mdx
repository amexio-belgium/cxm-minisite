	headline="Enterprise content challenges"
	description="
	<p>After working with enterprise organization on the topic of content management for over 20 years, we have witnessed a number recurring challenges:</p> 
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Inconsistent Customer Experiences:</strong> Without an integrated platform, it’s difficult to deliver a consistent brand message across different touchpoints like web, mobile, and social media, leading to poor customer engagement.</li>
		<li><strong>Content locked in silos:</strong> Too often, organizations have their content shattered in silos. They struggle with inflexible CMS systems, locking content into specific formats and channels while forcing the same generic workflow for all types of authors.</li>
		<li><strong>Fragmented Systems:</strong> Businesses often use multiple, disconnected systems for content creation, management, and delivery. This fragmentation leads to inefficiencies, errors, and delayed time-to-market.</li>
		<li><strong>Slow time-to-market:</strong> As businesses grow, scaling content creation and distribution becomes a significant bottleneck. Without a robust content supply chain, it’s challenging to manage the volume and complexity of content required for omnichannel delivery, resulting in reduced time-to-market.</li>
	</ol>
