	<p>The only way to achieve tangible business outcomes, is to use a <strong>holistic</strong> approach that spans from user experience (UX) design and technical implementation all the way to strategic guidance and team enablement.</p>
	<p>Therefore, we implement our FusionCX approach in your project, in which we closely <strong>collaborate</strong> with key stakeholders at your organization (IT, business, author teams and marketing) to define clear business goals, streamline content processes, and cultivate a culture of continuous optimization and experimentation.</p>
	<p>To ensure proper rollout and user adoption, we provide thorough onboarding and training for your teams, sharing best practices to ensure <strong>sustained</strong> success and a deep understanding of the tools and strategies at their disposal.</p>

	description="
	<p>Creating unified and seamless digital experiences is essential to engage with your various target audiences. A <strong>modular</strong> approach is therefore indispensible. By standardizing the way content and design are structured, governed and shared across different platforms, you can foster <strong>better collaboration</strong> and <strong>break down silos</strong> between your teams.</p>
	<p>The goal is to develop <strong>structured content models</strong> that can be implemented in one or more content management systems in your organization, making your content more flexible and scalable. Just as <strong>design systems</strong> break down UI components into smaller, reusable parts, content can be organized in a modular way, ensuring it fits seamlessly into different contexts.</p>
	<p>By separating content from design and ensuring everything works together smoothly, organizations can gradually implement these best-practices, creating a more mature and <strong>future-friendly CXM ecosystem</strong> that supports long-term success.</p>">

    description="
    <p>Successful CXM projects thrive on early and continuous feedback from business stakeholders and real end users. A traditional phased 'waterfall' approach, with its linear process of gathering requirements, designing, developing, and testing, is ill-suited for these projects. The risks associated with a waterfall process are significant: it can lead to extensive delays, unanticipated costs, and late discovery of critical issues, which may result in costly changes and ultimately deliver value only towards the end of the project.</p>
	<p>Therefore, we use Agile best-practices like DevOps and Test Automation in our FusionCX approach. This allows us to release early and often, facilitating a constant feedback loop. This enables us to gather real-world data, measure outcomes, and adapt our solutions to changing market trends, business requirements, and technological advancements.</p>
	<p>Launching a Minimum Marketable Product (MMP) early in the project lifecycle is central to this approach. It allows us to collect valuable data from actual users, which informs iterative improvements.</p>

<Faq headline="Questions we usually get">
	<FaqQuestion
		headline="How can we define our initial project scope?"
		headlineTag="h3"> 
		<p>At Amexio, we define the project’s initial scope by relying on Product Owners (POs). They focus on the product vision, identify key problems, and understand the target audience. POs gather and refine stakeholder inputs into user stories, which are then organized into a prioritized product backlog based on business value and cost. Our approach ensures this backlog remains dynamic, evolving iteratively to incorporate new ideas and adjustments, keeping the project aligned with its goals throughout.</p>
	</FaqQuestion>
	<FaqQuestion 
		headline="How can we estimate initial project budget?"
		headlineTag="h3" >
		<p>We estimate the initial project budget by calculating the cost of maintaining a stable Scrum Team over a set period. This involves identifying the required full-time equivalent (FTE) roles, including Business Consultants, Technical Leads, Developers, Testers, Architects, DevOps Engineers, and Project Managers. We prioritize team stability, understanding that simply increasing team size doesn’t linearly enhance productivity due to the overhead it creates. This approach ensures the project is both well-resourced and cost-efficient.</p>
	</FaqQuestion>
	<FaqQuestion 
		headline="How can we estimate the cost per user story?" >
		<p>We assign each task a value in Story Points using a method called Planning Poker. These points help estimate how much work the team can complete in a sprint, known as the team’s Velocity. Velocity is the total Story Points finished in a sprint and is key for predicting future work. After each sprint, Velocity is checked, and plans are adjusted, becoming more accurate over time. This ongoing process keeps project planning realistic and flexible.</p>
	</FaqQuestion>
	<FaqQuestion 
		headline="How does Amexio Fuse ensure project deadlines are met?">
		<p>We ensure project deadlines are met by embracing Agile principles, where scope details are flexible. By breaking down larger tasks into smaller, manageable pieces and regularly updating their estimates, our teams can adapt to changes and focus on completing the most critical elements on time. Backlog Grooming is essential in this process, as it helps prioritize tasks to deliver maximum business value. This approach not only ensures deadlines are met but also aligns them with delivering the most impactful outcomes.</p>
	</FaqQuestion>
	<FaqQuestion 
		headline="How much time should we spent analysing up-front?">
		<p>We allocate time for up-front analysis to reduce risk and uncertainty in Agile projects. This includes activities like technical analysis, prototyping, and feasibility studies, which help us understand the project landscape and mitigate risks related to business, technical, and cost/schedule factors. However, we defer detailed decision-making until necessary, allowing the project to adapt to new information. We establish high-level architecture early on, refining it during sprints to maintain flexibility and ensure the project remains aligned with customer value throughout its lifecycle.</p>
	</FaqQuestion>
	<FaqQuestion 
		headline="How can we organize testing?">
		<p>We organize testing by making sure it happens in every sprint, ensuring that each sprint results in a product that’s ready to ship. We use both automated and manual tests to check all parts of the product’s functionality and performance. By following a DevOps approach, we maintain continuous deployment and integration, keeping the product stable and quickly adaptable to changes. This ongoing testing helps us catch and fix issues early, reducing risks and improving the quality of the project.</p>
