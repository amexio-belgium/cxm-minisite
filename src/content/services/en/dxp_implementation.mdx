	headline="Experience management challenges at enterprises"
	description="
	<p>In today’s digital-first world, delivering consistent, engaging, and <strong>personalized experiences across channels</strong> is essential to stay competitive. However, businesses often face significant challenges when it comes to creating, managing and optimizing these experiences.</p>
	<p>We have witnessed a number recurring challenges at our clients:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Inconsistent Customer Experiences:</strong> Without an integrated platform, it’s difficult to deliver a consistent brand message across different touchpoints like web, mobile, and social media, leading to poor customer engagement.</li>
		<li><strong>Content locked in silos:</strong> Too often, organizations have their content shattered in silos. They struggle with inflexible CMS systems, locking content into specific formats and channels while forcing the same generic workflow for all types of authors.</li>
		<li><strong>Outdated technology stacks:</strong> This often results in limited integration capabilities, lack of flexibility and scalability, high maintenance costs and technical debt and the inability to leverage emerging capabilities like Artificial Intelligence (AI)</li>
		<li><strong>Slow time-to-market:</strong> As businesses grow, scaling content creation and distribution becomes a significant bottleneck. Without a robust content supply chain, it’s challenging to manage the volume and complexity of content required for omnichannel delivery, resulting in reduced time-to-market.</li>

	headline="DXP Suite or Composable DXP?"
	description="
	<p>The composition of a DXP depends on the unique needs of your organization. Since every business operates with different goals, customer journeys, and internal structures, your DXP must be flexible and modular, allowing you to choose the right tools and capabilities that align with your objectives.</p><p>Over the past years, <strong>two categories</strong> of DXP have emerged in the market: Composable DXP and DXP Suites.</p>
	<h3>DXP Suite</h3>
	<p>With a DXP Suite, you invest in a broader marketing platform, supported by a <strong>single vendor</strong>. These kind of systems offer a broad set of <strong>tightly integrated</strong> solutions, providing business users with autonomy and ease-of-use. Key features include capabilities like in-context editing, off-the-shelf analytics, personalisation tooling and integrated asset management. Typically, these suites come with a <strong>hybrid CMS</strong>, providing advanced website management and page-building capabilities for business users as well as the ability to deliver content across channels using APIs.</p>
	<h3>Composable DXP</h3>
	<p>As your organizations becomes more <strong>digitally mature</strong>, you will find yourself in need for a more scalable and flexible digital ecosystem supporting your growth. A composable architecture is characterised by a strong <strong>decoupling of capabilities</strong>. This kind of architecture typically includes a <strong>native headless CMS</strong>, advanced integration layers and cloud-native microservices. It provides your organization with more freedom to compose your digital ecosystem by choosing <strong>best-of-breed</strong> solutions, fitting your specific needs. It is ideal for businesses with a mature vision on IT and CX.</p>

	headline="Headless or hybrid architecture?"
	description="
	<p>A modern DXP typically comes with either a Hybrid CMS or a Headless CMS. Each offers distinct advantages depending on the complexity of your digital experience needs and the channels you need to support.</p>
	<h3>Hybrid: Balancing Flexibility and Ease of Use</h3>
	<p>With a hybrid CMS, you get the channel-agnostic content management necessary for omnichannel experiences, alongside the convenience of WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) editors or page builders when needed. This approach <strong>supports both developers and business users</strong>, making it an attractive option for organizations looking to balance omnichannel complexity with ease of use.</p>
	<h3>Headless CMS: Ultimate flexibility for omnichannel experiences</h3>
	<p>Headless CMSs focus strongly on <strong>structured content</strong>, organizing information in a way that is independent of any specific layout or design, making it <strong>reusable and scalable by nature</strong>. By embracing proper semantics in how content is stored and managed, businesses can more easily adapt content for different formats without needing to recreate or reformat it for each channel. However, this decoupling comes at the cost of having more limited visual editing tools or page-building capabilities, so teams have a stronger dependency on IT to manage the presentation layer for each channel.</p>

<Faq headline="Questions we usually get">
	<FaqQuestion
		headline="Should we go for a DXP Suite, or rather a Composable DXP?"
		headlineTag="h3"> 
		<p>At Amexio, we define the project’s initial scope by relying on Product Owners (POs). They focus on the product vision, identify key problems, and understand the target audience. POs gather and refine stakeholder inputs into user stories, which are then organized into a prioritized product backlog based on business value and cost. Our approach ensures this backlog remains dynamic, evolving iteratively to incorporate new ideas and adjustments, keeping the project aligned with its goals throughout.</p>
	</FaqQuestion>
	<FaqQuestion 
		headline="How can we estimate initial project budget?"
		headlineTag="h3" >
		<p>We estimate the initial project budget by calculating the cost of maintaining a stable Scrum Team over a set period. This involves identifying the required full-time equivalent (FTE) roles, including Business Consultants, Technical Leads, Developers, Testers, Architects, DevOps Engineers, and Project Managers. We prioritize team stability, understanding that simply increasing team size doesn’t linearly enhance productivity due to the overhead it creates. This approach ensures the project is both well-resourced and cost-efficient.</p>
	</FaqQuestion>
	<FaqQuestion 
		headline="How can we estimate the cost per user story?" >
		<p>We assign each task a value in Story Points using a method called Planning Poker. These points help estimate how much work the team can complete in a sprint, known as the team’s Velocity. Velocity is the total Story Points finished in a sprint and is key for predicting future work. After each sprint, Velocity is checked, and plans are adjusted, becoming more accurate over time. This ongoing process keeps project planning realistic and flexible.</p>
	</FaqQuestion>
	<FaqQuestion 
		headline="How does Amexio Fuse ensure project deadlines are met?">
		<p>We ensure project deadlines are met by embracing Agile principles, where scope details are flexible. By breaking down larger tasks into smaller, manageable pieces and regularly updating their estimates, our teams can adapt to changes and focus on completing the most critical elements on time. Backlog Grooming is essential in this process, as it helps prioritize tasks to deliver maximum business value. This approach not only ensures deadlines are met but also aligns them with delivering the most impactful outcomes.</p>
	</FaqQuestion>
	<FaqQuestion 
		headline="How much time should we spent analysing up-front?">
		<p>We allocate time for up-front analysis to reduce risk and uncertainty in Agile projects. This includes activities like technical analysis, prototyping, and feasibility studies, which help us understand the project landscape and mitigate risks related to business, technical, and cost/schedule factors. However, we defer detailed decision-making until necessary, allowing the project to adapt to new information. We establish high-level architecture early on, refining it during sprints to maintain flexibility and ensure the project remains aligned with customer value throughout its lifecycle.</p>
	</FaqQuestion>
	<FaqQuestion 
		headline="How can we organize testing?">
		<p>We organize testing by making sure it happens in every sprint, ensuring that each sprint results in a product that’s ready to ship. We use both automated and manual tests to check all parts of the product’s functionality and performance. By following a DevOps approach, we maintain continuous deployment and integration, keeping the product stable and quickly adaptable to changes. This ongoing testing helps us catch and fix issues early, reducing risks and improving the quality of the project.</p>
