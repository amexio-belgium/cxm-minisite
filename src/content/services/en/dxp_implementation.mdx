	headline="Experience management challenges at enterprises"
	description="
	<p>In today’s digital-first world, delivering consistent, engaging, and <strong>personalized experiences across channels</strong> is essential to stay competitive. However, businesses often face significant challenges when it comes to creating, managing and optimizing these experiences.</p>
	<p>We have witnessed a number recurring challenges at our clients:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Inconsistent Customer Experiences:</strong> Without an integrated platform, it’s difficult to deliver a consistent brand message across different touchpoints like web, mobile, and social media, leading to poor customer engagement.</li>
		<li><strong>Content locked in silos:</strong> Too often, organizations have their content shattered in silos. They struggle with inflexible CMS systems, locking content into specific formats and channels while forcing the same generic workflow for all types of authors.</li>
		<li><strong>Outdated technology stacks:</strong> This often results in limited integration capabilities, lack of flexibility and scalability, high maintenance costs and technical debt and the inability to leverage emerging capabilities like Artificial Intelligence (AI)</li>
		<li><strong>Slow time-to-market:</strong> As businesses grow, scaling content creation and distribution becomes a significant bottleneck. Without a robust content supply chain, it’s challenging to manage the volume and complexity of content required for omnichannel delivery, resulting in reduced time-to-market.</li>

	description="
	<p>The composition of a DXP depends on the unique needs of your organization. Since every business operates with different goals, customer journeys, and internal structures, your DXP must be flexible and modular, allowing you to choose the right tools and capabilities that align with your objectives.</p><p>Over the past years, <strong>two categories</strong> of DXP have emerged in the market: Composable DXP and DXP Suites.</p>
	<h3>DXP Suite</h3>
	<ol>
	<li>A complete solution from one single vendor</li>
	<li>Pre-integrated tools ensure out-of-the-box compatibility</li>
	<li>A unified interface for simplified use and management</li>
	<li>Often delivered as a managed cloud solution, reducing infrastructure concerns</li>
	<li>Vendor sets the product roadmap, ensuring consistent upgrades and innovations</li>
	<li>Flexible modular approach to expand functionality as needed</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Composable DXP</h3>
	<ol>
	<li>A custom mix of tools from multiple vendors tailored to your specific business context</li>
	<li>Requires integrations and connectors for seamless flow of content and data</li>
	<li>Provides flexibility to choose best-in-class solutions for specific functions</li>
	<li>Individual UIs for different tools, with centralized oversight</li>
	<li>Ideal for businesses with a robust IT and business vision to manage multiple platforms</li>

<Faq headline="Questions we usually get">
	<FaqQuestion
		headline="How can we define our initial project scope?"
		headlineTag="h3"> 
		<p>At Amexio, we define the project’s initial scope by relying on Product Owners (POs). They focus on the product vision, identify key problems, and understand the target audience. POs gather and refine stakeholder inputs into user stories, which are then organized into a prioritized product backlog based on business value and cost. Our approach ensures this backlog remains dynamic, evolving iteratively to incorporate new ideas and adjustments, keeping the project aligned with its goals throughout.</p>
	</FaqQuestion>
	<FaqQuestion 
		headline="How can we estimate initial project budget?"
		headlineTag="h3" >
		<p>We estimate the initial project budget by calculating the cost of maintaining a stable Scrum Team over a set period. This involves identifying the required full-time equivalent (FTE) roles, including Business Consultants, Technical Leads, Developers, Testers, Architects, DevOps Engineers, and Project Managers. We prioritize team stability, understanding that simply increasing team size doesn’t linearly enhance productivity due to the overhead it creates. This approach ensures the project is both well-resourced and cost-efficient.</p>
	</FaqQuestion>
	<FaqQuestion 
		headline="How can we estimate the cost per user story?" >
		<p>We assign each task a value in Story Points using a method called Planning Poker. These points help estimate how much work the team can complete in a sprint, known as the team’s Velocity. Velocity is the total Story Points finished in a sprint and is key for predicting future work. After each sprint, Velocity is checked, and plans are adjusted, becoming more accurate over time. This ongoing process keeps project planning realistic and flexible.</p>
	</FaqQuestion>
	<FaqQuestion 
		headline="How does Amexio Fuse ensure project deadlines are met?">
		<p>We ensure project deadlines are met by embracing Agile principles, where scope details are flexible. By breaking down larger tasks into smaller, manageable pieces and regularly updating their estimates, our teams can adapt to changes and focus on completing the most critical elements on time. Backlog Grooming is essential in this process, as it helps prioritize tasks to deliver maximum business value. This approach not only ensures deadlines are met but also aligns them with delivering the most impactful outcomes.</p>
	</FaqQuestion>
	<FaqQuestion 
		headline="How much time should we spent analysing up-front?">
		<p>We allocate time for up-front analysis to reduce risk and uncertainty in Agile projects. This includes activities like technical analysis, prototyping, and feasibility studies, which help us understand the project landscape and mitigate risks related to business, technical, and cost/schedule factors. However, we defer detailed decision-making until necessary, allowing the project to adapt to new information. We establish high-level architecture early on, refining it during sprints to maintain flexibility and ensure the project remains aligned with customer value throughout its lifecycle.</p>
	</FaqQuestion>
	<FaqQuestion 
		headline="How can we organize testing?">
		<p>We organize testing by making sure it happens in every sprint, ensuring that each sprint results in a product that’s ready to ship. We use both automated and manual tests to check all parts of the product’s functionality and performance. By following a DevOps approach, we maintain continuous deployment and integration, keeping the product stable and quickly adaptable to changes. This ongoing testing helps us catch and fix issues early, reducing risks and improving the quality of the project.</p>
