	headline="Experience management challenges at enterprises"
	description="
	<p>In today’s digital-first world, delivering consistent, engaging, and <strong>personalized experiences across channels</strong> is essential to stay competitive. However, businesses often face significant challenges when it comes to creating, managing and optimizing these experiences.</p>
	<p>We have witnessed a number recurring challenges at our clients:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Inconsistent Customer Experiences:</strong> Without an integrated platform, it’s difficult to deliver a consistent brand message across different touchpoints like web, mobile, and social media, leading to poor customer engagement.</li>
		<li><strong>Content locked in silos:</strong> Too often, organizations have their content shattered in silos. They struggle with inflexible CMS systems, locking content into specific formats and channels while forcing the same generic workflow for all types of authors.</li>
		<li><strong>Outdated technology stacks:</strong> This often results in limited integration capabilities, lack of flexibility and scalability, high maintenance costs and technical debt and the inability to leverage emerging capabilities like Artificial Intelligence (AI)</li>
		<li><strong>Slow time-to-market:</strong> As businesses grow, scaling content creation and distribution becomes a significant bottleneck. Without a robust content supply chain, it’s challenging to manage the volume and complexity of content required for omnichannel delivery, resulting in reduced time-to-market.</li>

	headline="DXP Suite or Composable DXP?"
	description="
	<p>The composition of a DXP depends on the unique needs of your organization. Since every business operates with different goals, customer journeys, and internal structures, your DXP must be flexible and modular, allowing you to choose the right tools and capabilities that align with your objectives.</p><p>Over the past years, <strong>two categories</strong> of DXP have emerged in the market: Composable DXP and DXP Suites.</p>
	<h3>DXP Suite</h3>
	<p>With a DXP Suite, you invest in a broader marketing platform, supported by a <strong>single vendor</strong>. These kind of systems offer a broad set of <strong>tightly integrated</strong> solutions, providing business users with autonomy and ease-of-use. Key features include capabilities like in-context editing, off-the-shelf analytics, personalisation tooling and integrated asset management. Typically, these suites come with a <strong>hybrid CMS</strong>, providing advanced website management and page-building capabilities for business users as well as the ability to deliver content across channels using APIs.</p>
	<h3>Composable DXP</h3>
	<p>As your organizations becomes more <strong>digitally mature</strong>, you will find yourself in need for a more scalable and flexible digital ecosystem supporting your growth. A composable architecture is characterised by a strong <strong>decoupling of capabilities</strong>. This kind of architecture typically includes a <strong>native headless CMS</strong>, advanced integration layers and cloud-native microservices. It provides your organization with more freedom to compose your digital ecosystem by choosing <strong>best-of-breed</strong> solutions, fitting your specific needs. It is ideal for businesses with a mature vision on IT and CX.</p>

	headline="Headless or hybrid architecture?"
	description="
	<p>A modern DXP typically comes with either a Hybrid CMS or a Headless CMS. Each offers distinct advantages depending on the complexity of your digital experience needs and the channels you need to support.</p>
	<h3>Hybrid: Balancing Flexibility and Ease of Use</h3>
	<p>With a hybrid CMS, you get the channel-agnostic content management necessary for omnichannel experiences, alongside the convenience of WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) editors or page builders when needed. This approach <strong>supports both developers and business users</strong>, making it an attractive option for organizations looking to balance omnichannel complexity with ease of use.</p>
	<h3>Headless CMS: Ultimate flexibility for omnichannel experiences</h3>
	<p>Headless CMSs focus strongly on <strong>structured content</strong>, organizing information in a way that is independent of any specific layout or design, making it <strong>reusable and scalable by nature</strong>. By embracing proper semantics in how content is stored and managed, businesses can more easily adapt content for different formats without needing to recreate or reformat it for each channel. However, this decoupling comes at the cost of having more limited visual editing tools or page-building capabilities, so teams have a stronger dependency on IT to manage the presentation layer for each channel.</p>

<Faq headline="Questions we usually get">
	<FaqQuestion 
		headline="Is a DXP essential to support my Content Supply Chain?">
		<p>A DXP forms the backbone of your Content Supply Chain, since it can go beyond streamlining the creation, management, and distribution of content across all your channels. It also provides capabilities to optimize and personalize your content using customer data.</p>
	</FaqQuestion>
	<FaqQuestion 
		headline="How is a DXP usually implemented?">
		<p>We advise to take an <strong>incremental approach</strong> instead of a 'big-bang' roll out. Therefore, DXP implementations are typically progressive processes that start with deploying a base platform and integrating your existing systems and enterprise applications. Next, we typically roll out features <strong>step-by-step</strong>, ensuring smooth transitions and minimizing disruption. This approach allows your organization to scale the platform as needed, integrating additional tools and channels over time.</p>
	</FaqQuestion>
	<FaqQuestion
		headline="Which products do we use to implement DXPs at our clients?"
		headlineTag="h3">

		<p>We also implement <strong>Drupal</strong> in an open-source context. Drupal is a flexible hybrid CMS that fits well within a modern Composable DXP.</p> 
	</FaqQuestion>
	<FaqQuestion 
		headline="Do we limit ourselves to these products?" >
		<p>Our strategy is not to support every product on the market. Instead, we focus on gaining <strong>deep expertise</strong> in a select number of core products, each serving sufficiently different use cases.</p>
		<p>On the Composable DXP front, we can help you to adopt a best-of-breed approach and <strong>compose</strong> a DXP tailored to your organization. Read more about our <a href='#'>Technology Advisory</a> service.</p>
		<p>When implementing headless delivery, our dedicated team of front-end experts can implement <strong>custom front-end applications</strong> using technologies like Next.js and Astro. Moreover, we have deep expertise in React, Angular and Vue for implementing dynamic web applications.</p>
	</FaqQuestion>
	<FaqQuestion 
		headline="What are the benefits of implementing a headless or hybrid CMS within a DXP?"
		headlineTag="h3" >
		<p>A headless CMS allows you to deliver content to any channel via APIs, offering flexibility for omnichannel strategies. It’s ideal for businesses that need to <strong>repurpose content</strong> across a large number of diverse platforms like mobile apps, kiosks, voice assistants or other marketing channels.</p>
		<p>A hybrid CMS combines this flexibility with the ease of use typically found in full-stack systems, offering advanced capabilties to <strong>design and manage web pages</strong> easily while supporting broader omnichannel experiences.</p>
		<p>While headless-only solutions often come with visual editing capabilties, they are mainly focused on editing isolated pieces of content and not so much on editing layouts and content presentation. Main reason for this is their absolute focus on storing content in a <strong>channel-agnostic</strong> way, to ensure maxmimal reuse.</p>
	</FaqQuestion>
	<FaqQuestion 
		headline="How do I choose between an DXP Suite and a Composable DXP approach?">
		<p>An DXP Suite is managed by a single vendor, offering pre-integrated tools and simplified user interfaces. It’s ideal for businesses seeking ease of use and a <strong>vendor-defined product roadmap</strong>.</p>
		<p>A Composable DXP, on the other hand, combines different tools from multiple vendors to create a custom solution <strong>tailored</strong> to your specific business needs. This approach requires a more robust IT vision but offers greater flexibility and scalability.</p>
