	description="<strong>70%</strong> of all content in your organization is unstructured. How can you make the most of it? We know managing unstructured content can be overwhelming. Without a clear approach to <strong>content governance</strong>, you face efficiency issues that turn processes into time-consuming and costly tasks. Your customers also struggle to find the right information on your digital channels.<br /><br />You might think a Large Language Model (LLM) is the fix, right? But LLMs often lack domain knowledge and can deliver inaccurate information, falling short of providing a truly qualitative experience. That’s where Content Science comes in. It facilitates the <strong>structure and precision</strong> needed to manage your unstructured content effectively, ensuring your customers get accurate and up-to-date information every time.">

    description="Techniques like <strong>Retrieval Augmented Generation</strong> (RAG) are not a magic bullet. Without a centralized content governance process and additional content enrichment or context classification, the output of Generative AI models often falls short for high-end production use cases.<br /><br />Content Science, however, is the answer. It focuses on harnessing your unstructured content to its fullest potential by optimizing its lifecycle for AI use cases, ensuring your content is managed effectively and used to its greatest advantage.">

	headline="Discover Content Pipelines"
	description="Content teams often struggle with content that is siloed, unstructured, and scattered across various sources. A Content Pipeline allows you to apply the discipline of Content Science by <strong>transforming raw content</strong> into structured, annotated, and accessible information, significantly enhancing the performance of applied AI models.<br /><br />A Content Pipeline <strong>complements</strong> your RAG setup by collecting and connecting diverse data sources. It begins by cleaning and filtering the content to remove noise and irrelevant information. Then, classification and annotation processes organize the content into meaningful categories and add valuable metadata. Constructing a <strong>knowledge graph</strong> embeds these structured insights, creating rich, interconnected data representations.">

	headline="Typical use cases for Content Pipelines"
	description="Content pipelines can be used in various business scenarios, such as:
	<ul>
		<li>Customer Support Automation: Improve AI chatbots and virtual assistants with accurate, up-to-date information for better customer service.</li>
		<li>Knowledge Management: Organize and structure large volumes of internal documents, making it easier for employees to find and use information.</li>
		<li>Content Personalization: Deliver tailored content to users based on their preferences and behavior, boosting engagement and conversion rates.</li>
		<li>Regulatory Compliance: Ensure all content meets industry regulations by systematically categorizing and tagging it for easy retrieval and audits.</li>
		<li>Product Information Management: Structure product data for e-commerce platforms, ensuring consistency and accuracy across all channels.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>At Amexio, we know that defining initial business cases can be tough.

	<FaqQuestion
		headline="Is Content Science related to Data Science?"
		headlineTag="h3"> 
		<p>Content Science can indeed be seen as the counterpart of Data Science: Content Science focuses on the systematic organization, classification, and management of unstructured content to enforce higher-quality results in content retrieval scenarios using AI models. Data Science, on the hand, involves the extraction of insights from structured data through statistical analysis, machine learning, and other advanced analytical techniques. It is typically used for audience segmentation, content personalization and recommendations.</p>
