        <ContentText>
            <p>The OECD, or Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, it a prominent intergovernmental organization with over 3,500 employees, advises governments on creating better policies for improved global well-being. Operating as a forum and knowledge hub for over 100 countries, the OECD plays a critical role in shaping policies through trusted statistics, standards, and analysis.</p>
        </ContentText>
        <ContentHeadline headlineTag="h2">Project challenge</ContentHeadline>
        <ContentText>
            <p>OECD’s digital presence, particularly its primary website, OECD.org, was outdated, presenting significant risks in terms of obsolescence and security while limiting the potential for modernization. The previous web content management system (CMS) was based on an old and unsupported platform, which had not been updated in years.</p>
            <p>This situation posed several challenges:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Security Risks</strong>: The outdated platform presented numerous security vulnerabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Modernization Needs</strong>: The aging website limited OECD’s ability to present a cohesive, modern digital presence.</li>
                <li><strong>Content Management</strong>: With years of accumulated content, there was an urgent need to clean up, archive, and reorganize the site’s content for relevance and user engagement.</li>
                <li><strong>Complex Ecosystem</strong>: The OECD’s ecosystem of satellite websites required a new hosting paradigm and operational model to manage their interconnectedness effectively.</li>
            </ul>

            <ContentHeadline headlineTag="h2">Goals and objectives</ContentHeadline>
            <p>Together with the OECD, we defined the plan to design and implement a revamped digital presence, based on a modern and user-friendly CMS. 4 main goals were set for the project:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Improve <strong>communication and engagement</strong> with visitors and stakeholders.</li>
                <li>Enhance the security and <strong>future-proofing</strong> of their digital presence.</li>
                <li>Streamline <strong>content management</strong> across OECD.org and its satellite sites.</li>
                <li>Increase <strong>operational efficiency</strong> and reduce costs associated with digital content management.</li>
            </ul>

            <ol>
                <li>Inception: Defined scope, requirements, and budget, leading to an official project kickoff.</li>
                <li>Elaboration: Detailed solution design, covering technical architecture, content structure, and visual design in collaboration with a design partner.</li>
                <li>Implementation: Iterative development with bi-monthly interactions for demos, user acceptance testing (UAT), and deployment.</li>
                <li>Transition: Ensured smooth handover to end-users, facilitated training, and captured feedback during a warranty period.</li>
                <li>Production: Supported the public launch with a detailed go-live plan and provided immediate post-launch support.</li>

        <ContentHeadline headlineTag="h2">Results and roadmap</ContentHeadline>
        <ContentText>
            <p>This project has positioned OECD.org as a <strong>modern, efficient, and secure platform</strong> capable of supporting the organization’s digital goals. Future work includes ongoing improvements to the website, onboarding additional satellite sites, and conducting an accessibility audit to ensure compliance with the latest standards.</p>
            <p>AmeXio continues to partner with the OECD, focusing on the evolution and enhancement of their digital ecosystem, ensuring it remains a cutting-edge platform for global policy dialogue.</p>
